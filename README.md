### Introduction

Saloon offers a fluent, object-oriented framework to build your next API integration or PHP SDK. It makes repeating requests and sharing them around your application a breeze. You don’t have to configure a HTTP client, so you can start making requests really quickly.

If you need request faking for your tests, Saloon has it out of the box alongside many other useful tools like OAuth2 boilerplate and caching support. If you are using Laravel, there's also a dedicated Laravel package with artisan commands to help you build even faster.

### Features

* Simple, easy to learn syntax that standardises the way you interact with APIs
* Abstract API integrations into classes so you can keep your code DRY
* Configuration is fast and can be shared across all your requests
* Framework agnostic
* Mocking requests for testing
* Great for building your own PHP SDKs
* Authentication & OAuth2 boilerplate already built for you
* Scalable with lots of API integrations across many team members
